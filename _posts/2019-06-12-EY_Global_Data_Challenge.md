The EY NextWave Data Science Challenge 2019 focuses on how data can help the next smart city thrive, and boost the mobility of the future.

> As a challenge participant, I downloaded a dataset with a vast number of anonymous geolocation records from the US city of  Atlanta (Georgia), during October 2018. my task is to produce a model that helps understand the journeys of citizens while they move in the city throughout the day. When digging deep into the challenge, I find the work could inspire solutions that help cities anticipate disruptions, make real-time decisions, design new services, and reshape infrastructures in order to become a city as smart as their citizens.

Technically speaking, this is a predictive analysis that applied models to determine (binary classification) the response features based on other independent variables. 

The evaluation standard is to check the accuracy score when applying the model (developed using training data) to the testing data and how well the model is built based on logic, run-time efficiency, generalization and space of tuning etc. 

- Here is an simple glance of the data:
