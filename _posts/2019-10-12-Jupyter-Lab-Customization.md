## Overview
JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing.

Fundamentally, JupyterLab is designed as an extensible environment. JupyterLab extensions can customize or enhance any part of JupyterLab. They can provide new themes, file viewers and editors, or renderers for rich outputs in notebooks.

## Example

Ideally, JupyerLab could be used to run multiple languages and edit documents all together on one platform.

- An example of my JupyterLab after customization with different environments and extensions, I could use it to write R, Python, Matlab and though not listed in the page, C++, Julia, Rugby, etc. And I can use my JupyterLab as a terminal, a diagram painter, a SQL interface to connect with different databases and file editors, a video player and a web browser.
