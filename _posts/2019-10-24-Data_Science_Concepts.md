## Data Science 

Multi-disciplinary field that brings together concepts from computer science, statistics/machine learning, and data analysis to understand and extract insights from the ever-increasing amounts of data.

1. Hypothesis-Driven: Given a problem, what kind of data do we need to help solve it?

2. Data-Driven: Given some data, what interesting problems can be solved with it

3. what can we learn from data and what actions to take?

## Types of data 

1. **Structured**: Data that has predefined structures. e.g. tables, spreadsheets, or relational databases.

2. **Unstructured Data:**: Data with no predefined struc- ture, comes in any size or form, **CANNOT be** easily stored in tables. e.g. blobs of text, images, audio

3. **Quantitative Data**: Numerical. e.g. height, weight 

4. **Categorical Data**: Data that can be labeled or divided into groups. e.g. race, sex, hair color.

5. **Big Data**: Massive datasets, or data that contains; greater variety arriving in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity (3 Vs). Cannot fit in the memory of a single machine.

### Data Source / Format


#### Most Common Data Formats

CSV, XML, SQL, JSON, Protocol Bu↵ers

#### Data Sources 

Companies/Proprietary Data, APIs, Gov- ernment, Academic, Web Scraping/Crawling




### Data Science Problem Types:

#### **Classification**: 
Assigning something to a discrete set of possibilities. e.g. spam or non-spam, Democrat or Repub- lican, blood type (A, B, AB, O)

#### **Regression**: 
Predicting a numerical value. e.g. some- one’s income, next year GDP, stock price


## Probablity

Probability theory provides a framework for reasoning about likelihood of events.


#### Experiment: 
procedure that yields one of a possible set of outcomes e.g. repeatedly tossing a die or coin.

#### Sample Space S:
set of possible outcomes of an experi- ment e.g. if tossing a die, S = (1,2,3,4,5,6)

#### Event E: 
set of outcomes of an experiment e.g. event thatarollis5,ortheeventthatsumof2rollsis7

#### Probability of an Outcome
s or P(s): number that *satisfies 2 properties*.


$$ 0\leq P(s) \leq 1 $$

$$ \sum P(s) = 1 $$


#### Probability of Event E:
sum of the probabilities of the outcomes of the experiment:
$$ p(E) = \sum Ps⇢E p(s)$$


#### Random Variable V:
 numerical function on the out- comes of a probability space


#### Expected Value V:
$$ E(V) = \sum(s\space belongs\space to\space s) P(s) * V(s)$$
