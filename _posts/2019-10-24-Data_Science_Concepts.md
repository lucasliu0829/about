## Data Science 

Multi-disciplinary field that brings together concepts from computer science, statistics/machine learning, and data analysis to understand and extract insights from the ever-increasing amounts of data.

1. Hypothesis-Driven: Given a problem, what kind of data do we need to help solve it?

2. Data-Driven: Given some data, what interesting problems can be solved with it

3. what can we learn from data and what actions to take?

## Types of data 

1. **Structured**: Data that has predefined structures. e.g. tables, spreadsheets, or relational databases.

2. **Unstructured Data:**: Data with no predefined struc- ture, comes in any size or form, **CANNOT be** easily stored in tables. e.g. blobs of text, images, audio

3. **Quantitative Data**: Numerical. e.g. height, weight 

4. **Categorical Data**: Data that can be labeled or divided into groups. e.g. race, sex, hair color.

5. **Big Data**: Massive datasets, or data that contains; greater variety arriving in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity (3 Vs). Cannot fit in the memory of a single machine.

### Data Source / Format


- Most Common Data Formats CSV, XML, SQL, JSON, Protocol Buâ†µers

- Data Sources Companies/Proprietary Data, APIs, Gov- ernment, Academic, Web Scraping/Crawling
